# Disk Filler

Disk Filler is a utility app for iOS developers. 
The app lets you easily fill up a device's hard drive - with photos of a winking kitten - so you to test how your app deals with a (almost) full hard drive. This is useful for on-device testing of scenarios like:
- Trying to save a file to disk when there isn't enough space available
- The operating system removing files from your app’s temp directory
- Your app's response to disk space alerts

# How to use

The app is pretty simple - it can only do three things:
1. Fill the whole disk. Just tap the button and wait. It may take a while for large disks with lots of free space.
2. Clear some space. Tap or tap-and-hold the button to clear some space. Now you can test how your app responds when *it* is responsible for the drive running out of space.
3. Clear all files. This removes all the winking kittens that Disk Filler has put on the hard drive.
